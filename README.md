Businesses Proposal
Mission Statement: Empower Leaders to Harness Emotional Intelligence
Execution: Evaluating Emotion Through Tone Based Analyses
Business Need: Opportunity Based Training - Communication
Hypothesis: With technology offering more ways to connect customers to businesses, it can become difficult to truly understanding how your team is performing in correlation to your customers’ expectations. As the consumer market continues to evolve, the manager or supervisor of a customer facing team is always looking for tools to assist them in understanding their team’s performance.
With tone-based analyses already being explored to evaluate emotion within the customer service sphere, it becomes apparent that there is a need for a reporting tool which can support this analysis and break it down into a dashboard for easy review. 
Manager Insights:
With a tool which turns speech into text, the conversation will automatically be processed through an algorithm to interpret common emotion through tone and verbiage. 
With this information, the Manager can go in an evaluate each team member’s performance within this call. They will be able to view the hot spots of the call which ideally, would be positive markers.
Goal: The goal of this product is to enable managers to be self-sufficient during their 1on1s. Opposed to listening to each call individually and making an assessment on the go, this product will allow managers to see in real time the emotions portrayed through voice and enable them to focus more on performance management and individual development.
Aim: The product aims to assist managers in every aspect. With the tool identifying negative speech patterns, it will be able to depict if further training is required with that team member. With the ability to manually link training material to the product, once an area of opportunity is discovered, the manager can automatically assign training material to their team members.
